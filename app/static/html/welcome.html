                    <h3>About Shinybeez</h3>
                    <p>While quantitative modeling of behavioral economic phenomena has increased in popularity and led
                        to translational
                        successes in clinical practice and policy, complex analyses has remained a barrier for many
                        researchers and
                        practitioners. <em>shinybeez</em> addresses this gap by providing an intuitive interface for
                        conducting descriptive and
                        inferential analyses without requiring programming expertise. The app integrates features
                        previously scattered across
                        multiple tools, allowing users to upload data, calculate empirical measures, identify systematic
                        datasets, fit nonlinear
                        models, and visualize results - all within a single platform. <em>shinybeez</em> supports
                        various analysis types for
                        demand and discounting data, including indifference point data and the 27-Item Monetary Choice
                        Questionnaire. Built on R
                        Shiny and leveraging existing R packages, the app ensures reproducibility and consistency with
                        underlying analytical
                        methods while remaining flexible for future enhancements. Key advantages of <em>shinybeez</em>
                        include its accessibility
                        through web browsers or local installation, ability to handle large datasets, and customizable
                        data visualization
                        options. By consolidating behavioral economic tools into a user-friendly interface,
                        <em>shinybeez</em> aims to broaden
                        the reach of these analytical techniques and facilitate their application in addressing societal
                        issues.

                    <h3>Data Security</h3>
                    <p><em>shinybeez</em> is configured to operate under an ephemeral model, meaning that
                        your data and results are retained only during your individual
                        session, with no persistent storage on the server's disk or external databases.
                        Any given instance of a <em>shinybeez</em> session,
                        including this one, will end if you stop
                        interacting with the app for some specified period of time (approximately ten
                        minutes of no activity). Once this session ends or is refreshed, any data in
                        this session's memory is discarded. This approach aligns with
                        privacy-oriented design principles by
                        limiting the lifespan of sensitive information and eliminating the need for
                        secure data-wiping procedures. As a result, you can upload and analyze
                        data in <em>shinybeez</em> without concern for long-term data management, while also
                        maintaining compliance with institutional or regulatory guidelines that
                        discourage or prohibit prolonged storage of sensitive data.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, <em>shinybeez</em> only accepts data in a
                        predifined format including a subject id, prices/delays, responses,
                        and a grouping variable. Ensure none of these variables
                        contain personally identifiable information. If you want to
                        use <em>shinybeez</em> locally, please see the local
                        installation instructions.

                    <h5>Wide format</h5>
                    <p>Data collected from, say, Qualtrics, tend to come in what is
                        called 'wide' format
                        (see <a href='https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf'>Hadley Wickham's paper</a> on tidy
                        data
                        for more on the 'wide' and 'long' data). 'Wide' format data typically
                        consists of one row per participant and each price (or whatever the independent
                        variable is) is a column.
                        By default, <em>shinybeez</em> takes in this style of
                        data.</p>

                        <p>Data collected from, say, Qualtrics, tend to come in what is
                            called 'wide' format
                            (see <a href='https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf'>Hadley Wickham's paper</a> on
                            tidy

                            for more on the 'wide' and 'long' data). 'Wide' format data typically
                            consists of one row per participant and each price (or whatever the independent
                            variable is) is a column.
                            By default, <em>shinybeez</em> takes in this style of
                            data.</p>

                                are whether a grouping variable should be integrated into the results,
                                whether Q<sub>0</sub> should be constrained to a specific value, select whether

                                In the main panel of the app are two boxes with embedded tabs.
                                The box at the top contains information related to the data (i.e.,
                                information that does not require any curve fitting) and the box at the
                                bottom contains information related to the results of the curve fitting.
                                Once data are uploaded, the top box is populated with information
                                (by default, the uploaded data is displayed), and results
                                in the bottom box are populated after you click the 'Calculate' button.

                                An important feature to note is that each of the tables displayed in the
                                demand page can be exported in the following ways: 'Copy' will copy the
                                contents of the table to the clipboard; 'Print' will open an option to print
                                the table through the device print interface; 'CSV' will prompt saving
                                the table as a comma-separated text file; 'Excel' will prompt saving the table
                                as a Microsoft Excel file with a .xslx extension; 'PDF' will prompt to download
                                the table as a file with a .pdf extention.

                            <p>The last tab contains a table of criteria used for <em>identifying</em>
                                systematic datasets according to the

                                The reported values include the number of total criteria passed and whether
                                each individual criterion was met (passed) or not (fail). For each criterion,
                                the value is provided. Finally, the number of total positive values is
                                included in the final column. Note that this tab has additional features.
                                When you click to open the collapsable sidebar <em>within this tab</em>,
                                you will be
                                presented with adjustments that can be made to the criterion values
                                outlined in <a href='https://doi.org/10.1037/pha0000020'>Stein et al. (2015)</a>.
                                These values
                                are set at the defaults outlined in
                                <a href='https://doi.org/10.1037/pha0000020'>Stein et al. (2015)</a>
                                and changing these values will update the table. When a grouping variable is
                                specified, a group identificatio ncolumn is added, but the results do not change
                                as these criteria are only applied at the individual level.

                            <h3>Nonlinear Regression</h3>
                            The bottom box on the demand page has two tabs and displays the results of
                            the nonlinear curve fitting process in a tabular format (Model Results tab) and
                            graphical format (Plots tab). In the Model Results tab, a table is displayed
                            with the following information: equation, estimated Q<sub>0</sub> (including
                            standard error and confidence intervals), k value, estimated
                            alpha (including standard error and confidence intervals), R<sup>2</sup>, model
                            absolute sum of squares, standard deviation of the residuals, essential value,
                            derived O<sub>max</sub>, derived P<sub>max</sub>, and
                            analytic O<sub>max</sub> and analytic P<sub>max</sub>
                            (see <a href='https://doi.org/10.1037/pha0000268'>
                                Gilroy, 2019</a>). The last column of the table provides
                            a quick note on whether the model converged, and the results for a model that
                            has indication other than convergence should be interpreted with caution.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The aforementioned model results are applied to the data depending on the
                            analysis type chosen in the sidebar of the demand page. When the Fit to Group
                            (pooled) analysis type is chosen, a single regression model is fit to the
                            entire sample (all data points), and any dependence or clustering is ignored.
                            When the Fit to Group (mean) analysis
                            type is chosen, data are first aggregated by taking the mean of the y values at
                            each x value and a regression line is fit to those points. When the
                            Two Stage analysis type is chosen, a regression
                            model is fit to each individual subject separately. When a grouping variable
                            is specified the analysis types Fit to Group (pooled) and Fit to Group (mean)
                            will fit curves as just described except <em>within</em> each group. There is no
                            effect on whether a grouping variable is specified when the Two Stage analysis
                            type is selected.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The second tab in the results box contains a plot of the results based
                            on the settings specified in the sidebar, especially Analysis Type. Before
                            describing and showing what these plots look like, we describe some
                            plot customization settings in the collapsible side bar in the plot tab.
                            You may customize the plot title, the x-axis title, the y-axis title, and
                            (when applicable) the group legend title. In addition, you can specify
                            whether to (pseudo)log transform either the x or y axes.
                            Then, you may output the plot directly as a png, svg, or jpeg file, or
                            display the plot in the viewer window and choose additional formats such
                            as pdf, bmp, eps, or tiff. In this plot viewer, you may specify specific
                            height and width values, as well as file name.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When Fit to Group (pooled) analysis type is selected, all data points
                            will display with the best-fit line. Similarly, when
                            a group is specified the points and lines will be colored according to the
                            groups. When Fit to Group (mean) analysis type is specified,
                            the preprocessed average data points are displayed with the best fit line
                            and when a group is specified, the points and lines will be
                            colored according to the groups. Finally, when
                            Two Stage analysis type is selected, plots will be displayed in one of two
                            ways. When there are 50 or fewer IDs (e.g., respondents), each ID will get
                            their own subplot and when there are more than 50 IDs all
                            curves and points will be shown on a single plot.

                            <h6>Treatment of missing values</h6>
                            Missing values can be dealt with according to the methods outlined by
                            <a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292258'>
                                Yeh et al. (2023)</a>: 'none' (no imputation); 'GGM' (group
                            geometric mean); 'INN (no random)' (item nearest neighbor); and
                            'INN (random)'
                            (item nearest neighbor with a random component). We will briefly
                            discuss these
                            methods, but direct readers to
                            <a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292258'>
                                Yeh et al. (2023)</a> for a full,
                            comprehensive treatment of the approaches. After calculating the
                            small, medium, and large k values for each person, the 'GGM'
                            option calculates the geometric (i.e., composite) k value of the
                            three amount sets <em>so long as one of the amount sets has been
                                calculated</em>. For the 'INN (no random), the missing value will
                            be imputed as the value from the adjacent small, medium, or large
                            response(s) so long as the non-missing responses are the same. For
                            the 'INN (random)', the same procedure is used except in the case
                            of non-identical responses, the missing response will be replaced
                            by either a 0 (i.e., SIR/SS) or 1 (i.e., LDR/LL) chosen from a
                            binomial distribution with equal probabilities. Given the
                            randomness of this latter approach, a table of the provided data
                            along with an additional column with the new, imputed response is
                            provided in the bottom box of the Discounting page. For a more
                            complete description and comparisons of these methods, see the

                            <h3>Systematic Criteria for Indifference Points</h3>
                            <p><em>shinybeez</em> can examine discounting indifference points
                                for systematicity according to the two criteria outlined by
                                <a href='https://doi.org/10.1037/1064-1297.16.3.264'>Johnson & Bickel, 2008</a>.
                                The first criterion is that the indifference point at any delay should not be greater
                                than the preceding indifference point by more than 20% of the larger later reward.
                                The second criterion requires that the last indifference point (at the longest delay)
                                must be less than the first indifference point by at least 10% of the larger later
                                reward.
                                Violation of either criterion may indicate questionable data validity - the first
                                criterion
                                suggests delay increases rather than decreases reward value, while the second indicates
                                insufficient discounting across delays. <em>shinybeez</em> provides
                                results of these criteria for informational purposes and the
                                researcher needs to decide whether to include these response sets.
                                <em>shinybeez</em> will indicate a pass (true) or fail (false) for
                                each criterion for each response set. Users may also specify their
                                own thresholds in the sidebar.

                                    <em>shinybeez</em> provides nonlinear regression tools for
                                    analyzing indifference points from discounting tasks. The app supports
                                    fitting two widely used models: Mazur's (1987) hyperbolic discounting
                                    function and the exponential discounting function. Users can choose
                                    from three analysis approaches: Fit to Group (mean), Fit to Group
                                    (pooled), and Two Stage (individual-level fits).

                                    In addition to regression outputs, <em>shinybeez</em> calculates
                                    Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics, following the methods outlined
                                    by
                                    <a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/jeab.219'>Borges et al. (2016)</a>.
                                    Traditional AUC, ordinal AUC, and
                                    log-transformed AUC (log<sub>10</sub> AUC) are provided, offering
                                    flexibility in interpreting discounting behavior across tasks.

                                    For visualizing results, <em>shinybeez</em> automatically
                                    generates customizable plots. Users can adjust the plot title,
                                    x-axis label, and y-axis label, and specify whether the x-axis
                                    (delays) should be log-transformed. The generated plots can be
                                    saved directly from the interface in various formats, ensuring that
                                    users can easily share or embed their findings in reports and

                                Why am I getting errors when uploading a spreadsheet?
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                Currently, <em>shinybeez</em> will fail if two common issues are in the spreadsheets
                                you upload:

                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Duplicate IDs</b>: If there are duplicate IDs, then <em>shinybeez</em> will fail.
                                    This is because the underlying R package <em>beezemand</em> does not
                                    currently support duplicate IDs. This will be updated in the near future to
                                    handle the different ways of treating duplicate IDs.</li>

                                <li><b>"Phantom" columns at the end of the csv</b>: Ensure there are no "extra" columns
                                    at the end of the csv. You can do this by selecting any blank columns
                                    immediately proceeding the data and deleting them. You can also check for
                                    blank columns by opening up the csv in a text editor and looking at the end
                                    of the file.</li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>

                                zoom out. On Mac, you can use the <code>Cmd</code> and

                            <h5>Why is the F-test for group demand curves not available?</h5>
                            <p>Over time, with the increased awareness of mixed effects models,
                                we believe that using the 'Extra Sum of Squares F-test' is probably
                                not a good idea to test for differences in group-level demand curves
                                when the demand curves are fit using fixed effects only (i.e., no
                                random effects). The issue boils down to the purpose of group-level
                                only modeling. We believe that while this approach may be beneficial
                                to ascertain an overall trend in the data and to <em>describe</em>
                                the data, you should not use the results for subsequent
                                <em>inferential</em> tests, such as the F-test. Whether you use the
                                pooled approach or the fit to means approach, both of these
                                techniques disregard the clustering and interdependency of points
                                within an individual. For a lengthier discussion, please see

                            <p>Currenty <em>shinybeez</em> supports two of the most popular demand
                                models. This limitation is in part due to the <em>beezemand</em>
                                R package currently supporting only those two models. We expect
                                additional models to be implemented in the near future.</p>
                            <h5>How can I conduct cross-price elasticity analyses?</h5>
                            <p>This is currently not supported in <em>shinybeez</em>. However,
                                we are working on it and plan to have that feature in a future

                            <p>This is because the original paper by Kirby and colleagues
                                presented rounded k values. <em>shinybeez</em> and the underlying

                            cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</p>

                        <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are
                            designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By
                            contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
                            freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
                            remains free software for all its users.</p>

                        <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                            price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                            have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                            them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
                            want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
                            free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

                        <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
                            with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
                            you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
                            and/or modify the software.</p>

                        <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
                            improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
                            receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
                            incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and
                            encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of
                            software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
                            The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
                            letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
                            source code to the public.</p>

                        <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
                            ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
                            to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to
                            provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
                            users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
                            a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
                            code of the modified version.</p>

                        <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
                            published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is
                            a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
                            released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
                            this license.</p>

                        <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                            modification follow.</p>

                        <h4 id="terms">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>

                        <h4 id="section0">0. Definitions.</h4>

                        <p>&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
                            License.</p>

                        <p>&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
                            of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

                        <p>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
                            License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and
                            &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</p>

                        <p>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
                            in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
                            exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
                            earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p>

                        <p>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
                            on the Program.</p>

                        <p>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
                            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
                            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
                            computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
                            distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
                            public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

                        <p>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
                            parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
                            a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

                        <p>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
                            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
                            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
                            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
                            extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
                            work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
                            the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
                            menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

                        <h4 id="section1">1. Source Code.</h4>

                        <p>The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
                            for making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
                            form of a work.</p>

                        <p>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
                            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
                            interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
                            is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

                        <p>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
                            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
                            packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
                            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
                            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
                            implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
                            &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
                            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
                            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
                            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

                        <p>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
                            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
                            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
                            control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
                            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
                            programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
                            which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
                            includes interface definition files associated with source files for
                            the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
                            linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
                            such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
                            subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

                        <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
                            can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
                            Source.</p>

                        <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
                            same work.</p>

                        <h4 id="section2">2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

                        <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
                            copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
                            conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
                            permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
                            covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
                            content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
                            rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

                        <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
                            convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
                            in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
                            of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
                            with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
                            the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
                            not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
                            for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
                            and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
                            your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

                        <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
                            the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
                            makes it unnecessary.</p>

                        <h4 id="section3">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

                        <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
                            measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
                            11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
                            similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
                            measures.</p>

                        <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
                            circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
                            is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
                            the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
                            modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
                            users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
                            technological measures.</p>

                        <h4 id="section4">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

                        <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
                            receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
                            appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
                            keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
                            non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
                            keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
                            recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

                        <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
                            and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

                        <h4 id="section5">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

                        <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
                            produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
                            terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
                                it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

                            <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
                                released under this License and any conditions added under section
                                7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
                                &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</li>

                            <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
                                License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
                                License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
                                additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
                                regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
                                permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
                                invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

                            <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
                                Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
                                interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
                                work need not make them do so.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
                            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
                            and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
                            in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
                            &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
                            used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
                            beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
                            in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
                            parts of the aggregate.</p>

                        <h4 id="section6">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

                        <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
                            of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
                            machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
                            in one of these ways:</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                                (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
                                Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
                                customarily used for software interchange.</li>

                            <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                                (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
                                written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
                                long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
                                model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
                                copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
                                product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
                                medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
                                more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
                                conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
                                Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

                            <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
                                written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
                                alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
                                only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
                                with subsection 6b.</li>

                            <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
                                place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
                                Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
                                further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
                                Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
                                copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
                                may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
                                that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
                                clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
                                Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
                                Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
                                available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

                            <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
                                you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
                                Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
                                charge under subsection 6d.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
                            from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
                            included in conveying the object code work.</p>

                        <p>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
                            tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
                            or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
                            into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
                            doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
                            product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
                            typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
                            of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
                            actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
                            is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
                            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
                            the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

                        <p>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
                            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
                            and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
                            a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
                            suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
                            code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
                            modification has been made.</p>

                        <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
                            specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
                            part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
                            User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
                            fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
                            Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
                            by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
                            if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
                            modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
                            been installed in ROM).</p>

                        <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
                            requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
                            for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
                            the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
                            network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
                            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
                            protocols for communication across the network.</p>

                        <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
                            in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
                            documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
                            source code form), and must require no special password or key for
                            unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

                        <h4 id="section7">7. Additional Terms.</h4>

                        <p>&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
                            License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
                            Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
                            be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
                            that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
                            apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
                            under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
                            this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

                        <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
                            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
                            it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
                            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
                            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
                            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

                        <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
                            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
                            that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
                                terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

                            <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
                                author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
                                Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

                            <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
                                requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
                                reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

                            <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
                                authors of the material; or</li>

                            <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
                                trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

                            <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
                                material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
                                it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
                                any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
                                those licensors and authors.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
                            restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
                            received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
                            governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
                            you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
                            restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
                            may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
                            document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
                            relicensing or conveying.</p>

                        <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
                            must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
                            additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
                            where to find the applicable terms.</p>

                        <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
                            form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
                            the above requirements apply either way.</p>

                        <h4 id="section8">8. Termination.</h4>

                        <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
                            provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
                            modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
                            this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
                            paragraph of section 11).</p>

                        <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
                            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
                            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
                            finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
                            holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
                            prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                            copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                            your receipt of the notice.</p>

                        <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                            licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                            this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                            reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
                            material under section 10.</p>

                        <h4 id="section9">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

                        <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
                            run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
                            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
                            to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
                            nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
                            modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
                            not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
                            covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

                        <h4 id="section10">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

                        <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
                            receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
                            propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
                            for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

                        <p>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
                            organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
                            organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
                            work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
                            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
                            licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
                            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
                            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
                            the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

                        <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
                            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
                            not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
                            rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
                            (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
                            any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
                            sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

                        <h4 id="section11">11. Patents.</h4>

                        <p>A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
                            License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
                            work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.</p>

                        <p>A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
                            owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
                            hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
                            by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
                            but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
                            consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
                            purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
                            patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
                            this License.</p>

                        <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
                            patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
                            make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
                            propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

                        <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
                            agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
                            (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
                            sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
                            party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
                            patent against the party.</p>

                        <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
                            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
                            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
                            publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
                            then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
                            available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
                            patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
                            consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
                            license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
                            actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
                            covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
                            in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
                            country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

                        <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
                            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
                            covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
                            receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
                            or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
                            you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
                            work and works based on it.</p>

                        <p>A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
                            the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
                            conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
                            specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
                            work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
                            in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
                            to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
                            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
                            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
                            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
                            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
                            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
                            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
                            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

                        <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
                            any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
                            otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

                        <h4 id="section12">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

                        <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                            otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                            excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
                            covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                            License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
                            not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
                            to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
                            the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
                            License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

                        <h4 id="section13">13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.</h4>

                        <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
                            Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
                            interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
                            supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
                            Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
                            from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
                            means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source
                            shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
                            of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
                            following paragraph.</p>

                        <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
                            to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
                            of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to
                            convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to
                            apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is
                            combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public
                            License.</p>

                        <h4 id="section14">14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

                        <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
                            the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new
                            versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
                            in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

                        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
                            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero
                            General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have
                            the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
                            numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
                            Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
                            of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version
                            ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

                        <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
                            versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that
                            proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
                            authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>

                        <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
                            permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
                            author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
                            later version.</p>

                        <h4 id="section15">15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

                        <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
                            APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
                            HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
                            OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
                            THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                            PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
                            IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
                            ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

                        <h4 id="section16">16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

                        <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                            WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
                            THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
                            GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
                            USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
                            DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
                            PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
                            EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
                            SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

                        <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
                            above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
                            reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
                            an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
                            Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
                            copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
